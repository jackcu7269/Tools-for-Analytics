# Overview
### In March 2022, Uber announced that they will allow its New York City-based users to hire yellow taxis from its app. While we each all have our own preferences for how we get home on a late night, letâ€™s see if we can see some trends to back up why Uber and taxis have clashed for years. 

Using hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015, and joining with local historical weather data, the project use Jupyter notebook and SQL queries to answer particular questions by downloading and cleaning data, storing the data in a SQLite database, and providing visualizations.

Please look at Project.ipynb to read the detail of this project.
